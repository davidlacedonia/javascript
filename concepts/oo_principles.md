# OO

## Principles

- Single responsability

Classes should have a single responsability

- Open closed

Open for extension, but closed for modification

- DRY

Don't repeat yourself

- Dependency inversion

## Pillars

- encapsulation

  Group related variables/functions, and reduce complexity, and increase reusability

- inheritance

  Allows to elminate redundant code

- abstraction

  Helps reduce the impact of change

- polymorphism

  Multiple methods with same name on diff sub classes
