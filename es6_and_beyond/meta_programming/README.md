# Meta programming

Meta programming is programming where the operation targets the behavior of the program itself.

Meta programming focuses on one or more of the following: code inspecting itself, code modifying itself, or code modifying defualt language behavior so other code is affected.

The goal of meta programming is to leverage the language's own intrinsic capabilities to make the rest of your code more descriptive, expressive, and/or flexible.

## Function names

The lexical binding name is what you use for things like recursion. The `name` property is what you'd use for meta programming purposes (that's typically the name used in stack traces in developers tools).
